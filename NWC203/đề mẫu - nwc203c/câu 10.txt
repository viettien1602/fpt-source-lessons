câu 10
Suppose Host A wants to send a large file to Host B. The path from Host A
to Host B has three links, of rates R1 = 250 kbps, R2 = 3 Mbps, and R3 = 2
Mbps.
a. Assuming no other traffic in the network, what is the throughput for the file
transfer?
b. Suppose the file is 4 million bytes. Dividing the file size by the throughput,
roughly how long will it take to transfer the file to Host B?

R1 = 250 kbps
R2 = 3 Mbps
R3 = 2 Mbps
A) the throughput for the file
transfer = min{R1,R2,R3}= min{250 kbps, 3 Mbps, 2 Mbps} = 250kbps

B) the file size = 4 million bytes
-convert to bits = 32000000 bits
-From (a), Throughput for the file transfer=250 Kbps = =250000 bps
-File size/Throughput for the file transfer = 32000000/250000 = 128 giây(second)
