câu 7
7. A packet switch receives a packet and determines the outbound link to which
the packet should be forwarded. When the packet arrives, one other packet is
halfway done being transmitted on this outbound link and four other packets are
waiting to be transmitted. Packets are transmitted in order of arrival.
Suppose all packets are 2,500 bytes and the link rate is 3 Mbps. What is the
queuing delay for the packet? More generally, what is the queuing delay when all

packets have length L, the transmission rate is R, x bits of the currently-being-
transmitted packet have been transmitted, and n packets are already in the queue?
Ta có:
package length = L
transimision rate = R
curently transimitted packet = x bits
Waiting queue = n package

-Công thức queuing delay
Queuing delay = [(nL) + (L-x)]*R(Mbps)*n/R(bps)

ta có
L = 2500 bytes
R = 3 Mbps = 3*10^6 bps
x = 2500/2 = 1250 (transmit halfway)
n = 4(do có 4 package đang chờ chuyển)
                   giải
-[nL + (L-x)] = [(4*2500) + (2500-1250)]
               10000 + 1250 = 11250 bytes
-Package transmit rate at 3Mbps
 11250*3*4=135000
-Queuing delay = 135000/3*10^6 = 0.045 sec(giây)
