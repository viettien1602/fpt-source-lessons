câu 9
9. Consider a packet of length 2,000 bytes that propagates over a link of
distance 3,500 km with propagation speed of 2,5*10^8 m/s, and transmission
rate
2 Mbps?
a. How long does the packet propagation take?
b. Does this propagation delay depend on the packet length?
c. Does this propagation delay depend on the transmission rate?

Ta có
L = 1000 bytes
R =  3Mbps = 3*10^6
distance = 3500km
S = 2.5*10^8 m/s
                            giải
A) time = distance/S = (3500*10^3)/(2.5*10^8) = 0.014s = 14ms
B) Does this propagation delay depend on the packet length? (no)    |Lý thuyết nên đừng hỏi :))
C) Does this propagation delay depend on the transmission rate?(no) |
